On Ubuntu, the following packages are required to build.
	libevdev-dev
	libgtk-3-dev (with USE_GTK)
	libxdo-dev (with USE_XDO)
	libxml2-dev

On some systems, only the root user can create the uinput devices used for
device emulation.  To grant permission to create devices, create a 'uinput'
group (`groupadd uinput`), add a user to it (`gpasswd -a username uinput`), and
create a udev rule by adding the following line to
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules
	KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="uinput", MODE:="0660"
The same is also true of reading some input devices.  If necessary, create an
'input' group as above, add a user to it, and add the following line to
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-input.rules
	KERNEL=="input", GROUP="input", MODE:="0660"
A reboot is recommended to properly apply the new groups and udev rules.

Various settings can be changed in include/settings.h.

Makefile flags:
	GTK support (default disabled) can be enabled or disabled with
