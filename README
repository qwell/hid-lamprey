On Ubuntu, the following packages are required to build.
	libevdev-dev
	libgtk-3-dev (with USE_GTK)
	libxdo-dev
	libxml2-dev

On some systems, only the root user can create the uinput devices used for
device emulation.  To grant permission to create devices, create a uinput group
(`groupadd uinput`), add a user to it (`gpasswd -a username uinput`), and add
a rules file to udev by adding the following line to
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules
	KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="uinput", MODE:="0660"

Various settings can be changed in include/settings.h.

Makefile flags:
	GTK support can be added with `make USE_GTK=1`.
	Debugging can be added with `make DEBUG=1`
